# Text-Scanner

This is a text scanner. When ran, the final .jar file searches for a Text.txt file in the same folder as it. If such a file exists, it outputs information about the file to the console and creates a Result.txt file with this information.

I have provided the finished .jar file, a .bat file to run the .jar file easily, and a Text.txt file containing the bible as an example. Place these files in the same folder and run the batch file to test.

Finally, I have included the Maven project file as a .zip, containing the java code in full, and some .txt files that are used in testing.



## Rules Defining a Word:

Dates in the formats xx/xx/xxxx and xx/xx/xx are counted as a single word, as shown in the example.

Slash-separated words such as black/white are counted as seperate words, as are both numbers in a fraction.

Dash-seperated words are counted as a single word, and the dash is counted in the length.

Decimal points are counted towards the length of a number, as are commas, minus signs, percentages, dollars, and pounds (such as in -Â£1,000.00).

& is counted as a 1-letter word.

Punctuation is otherwise not counted towards the length of a word.
